# Twitter-sentiment-analysis
There are only 2 columns in this dataset which are clean_text and category. In clean_text, all the data of tweets is already cleaned so we don't need to clean it. First, we are dropping all the rows which contain the null value. To process this data, we are using CountVectorizer and then splitting training and test data. After that, we are using logistic regression in OneVsRestClassifier to train model on training data. At last, we are predicting sentiment from test data and achieved almost 95.2% accuracy on it. We can use confusion matrix to analyze performance of our trained model.
